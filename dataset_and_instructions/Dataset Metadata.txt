The dataset represents the results of patients from the HCHD study. The dataset includes 14 features as follows:
1. age: age in years
2. sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. cp: chest pain type
-- Value 1: typical angina
-- Value 2: atypical angina
-- Value 3: non-anginal pain
-- Value 4: asymptomatic
4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
-- Value 0: normal
-- Value 1: having ST-T (Stress test) wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
-- Value 1: upsloping
-- Value 2: flat
-- Value 3: downsloping
12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: thalassemia, 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. Outcome: diagnosis of heart disease (number of vassels affected)
-- Value 0: absent
-- Value 1: present (one major vassel)
-- Value 2: present (two major vassels)
-- Value 3: present (three major vassels)
-- Value 4: present (four major vassels)
